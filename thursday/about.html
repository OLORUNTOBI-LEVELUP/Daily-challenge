        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
           The  Wildlife Conservation Center is a sanctuary dedicated to preserving wildlife through conservation, research, education and quality animal care. WCC takes in injured and orphaned animals year-round and provides them with spacious enclosures and quality animal care. Most of the animals that arrive at the WCC become permanent residents and will always have a home here. The Center maintains over 200 acres of spacious habitats for animals to feel at home and display their natural “wild” behavior. Visitors may see brown bears cooling off in the water, a bull moose strutting, wood bison roaming on pastures and more.
